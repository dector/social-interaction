## Document purpose

This document conceived as a formalization of my own noncontradictory principles in personal relations with independent and self-sufficient individuals and those who are on the way to become one.

## 1. Personal Freedom

Personal freedom is a cornerstone of this principles. Thus I consider a relationship of personalities as an equal alliance for maximizing each participant's profit. Every type of dependency (physical, mental or emotional) can lead to distortion in equality thereby is considered as not desirable and not willingly by default.

### Open Questions

#### Self Harm

Obviously, self-harm is allowed for individuals according to this principle. However, cases, when it's not permissible is still an open question for me.

## 2. Honesty

All participants shouldn't manipulate others or lie to them even for "their own sake".  All participants should provide a maximum amount of related information required for another's person decision-making process. Everybody may demand this from other participants and may expect that other participants are followed by these principles as well.

## 3. Cooperation

I believe that cooperation is one of key principles for setting up healthy and mature interpersonal relationship. That means that I expect that all participants should try to put all possible efforts to understand and to percieve others correctly. In case of lack of information it shouldn't be implied but asked.

## 4. Discussions

Discussion based on previous principles (personal freedom, honesty and cooperation) is considered as the main instrument for resolving a conflict of interests, thoughts interchange, criticism providing and relationship development.

## Remarks

These principles are not final dogmas and are subject to discussion, extension, supplementation and correction if this is concerted with all  participants. However, current principles should be considered as a zero reference point for such changes.
